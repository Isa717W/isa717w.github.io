        <h1>Mother Knows Best? How Vocal Fry and Deceit Are Woven into Tangled</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Disney’s Tangled (2010) uses vocal nuances to sharply contrast its protagonist and antagonist, 
            embedding linguistic stereotypes into its storytelling. Mother Gothel, the film’s manipulative 
            villain, speaks with a breathy, lowered vocal register marked by vocal fry—a creaky voice quality 
            often associated with deceit or insincerity in media. Phonetically, her speech features a lowered 
            /ɑ/ in words like “flower” (pronounced [flaʊɚ]), elongating vowels to create an unsettling, overly 
            sweet tone. This contrasts starkly with Flynn Rider’s casual General American English (GAE), which 
            includes relaxed /ɪŋ/ endings (e.g., “somethin’” instead of “something”) and a lack of marked regional 
            features.</p>

        <p>Lippi-Green (2012) argues that Disney often codes villains with non-mainstream vocal traits to signal 
            moral corruption. Mother Gothel’s vocal fry and exaggerated prosody align with this trope, framing her 
            as untrustworthy despite her superficially nurturing demeanor. In scenes like “Mother Knows Best,” her 
            breathy delivery and elongated diphthongs (“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair”) create a performative 
            warmth that masks her selfish motives. Meanwhile, Flynn’s GAE—with its neutral vowels and rhotic 
            /r/—positions him as a relatable everyman, despite his roguish past.</p>
                
        <p>TThe film’s linguistic dichotomy reflects broader societal biases. Vocal fry, often criticized in women’s speech as “unprofessional” or “manipulative,” is weaponized here to villainize female authority. Conversely, Flynn’s “charming” lack of vocal affectation reinforces the idea that unmarked speech equates to integrity. This dynamic perpetuates harmful stereotypes about gendered communication, suggesting that women who deviate from vocal norms are inherently suspect.</p>  
                
        <p>Tangled’s accent choices also mirror historical Disney trends. From Ursula’s sultry contralto in The Little Mermaid to Scar’s British RP in The Lion King, marked vocal traits are used to “other” antagonists. Mother Gothel’s voice, performed by Donna Murphy, leans into this tradition, blending theatricality with linguistic manipulation. While the film’s portrayal of gaslighting and emotional abuse is nuanced, its reliance on vocal stereotypes undermines its potential to challenge gendered tropes.</p>
                
        <p>Ultimately, Tangled exemplifies Disney’s enduring habit of equating linguistic conformity with heroism. By coding Mother Gothel’s villainy through vocal fry and breathiness, the film reinforces the idea that women’s voices—especially those that defy “neutral” standards—are threats to be silenced.</p>
