        <h1>Roaring Backwards: The Lion King's Persistent Accent Hierarchies"</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Disney's 2025 remake of The Lion King: Mufasa regurgitates the original's problematic accent hierarchy. Simba, voiced by a 
            GAE-speaking actor, retains the rhotic /r/ (“pride” [pɹaɪd]) and neutral vowels that code him as heroic and morally sound. 
            In contrast, Scar’s British RP—non-rhotic /r/ (“king” [kɪŋ]) and elongated diphthongs—continues to frame him as effete and 
            elitist, a trope entrenched since Jeremy Irons’ 1994 portrayal.</p>

        <p> Lippi-Green's (2012) analysis of Disney's “accent moralizing” is stark here. Anger's NYC dialect, with its dropped /r/ (“park” 
            [pɑ:k]) and nasalized vowels, aligns with media portrayals of New Yorkers as brash and confrontational. His outbursts 
            (“Congratulations, San Francisco! You've ruined pizza!”) frame his accent as inherently combative, while Joy's GAE positions 
            her as universally relatable.</p>
                
        <p>The remake’s most regressive choice is erasing Kamari’s Chicano English, present in earlier drafts, in favor of GAE. This erasure, as Roberts (2022) notes, reflects Disney’s reluctance to embrace non-Anglo accents for central characters. Meanwhile, Pumbaa’s African American Vernacular English (AAVE)—monophthongal /aɪ/ (“time” [taːm]) and /ɪn/ → “-in’” suffixes—remains relegated to comic relief, perpetuating stereotypes of Black speech as unserious. Rafiki’s tapped /r/ ([ɾɑˈfiki]) and /ð/ → [d] substitutions (“the” → [də]) further exoticize him as a “mystical” other, divorcing his wisdom from linguistic legitimacy.</p>  
                
        <p>The 2025 remake had an opportunity to rectify the original’s racialized accent coding. Instead, it doubles down on Eurocentric norms. Scar’s RP accent, tied to British colonialism, reinforces the idea that non-rhotic speech signifies decadence, while Simba’s GAE upholds American linguistic hegemony. Even Mufasa’s deep, resonant GAE—voiced by James Earl Jones in 1994 and a new actor here—frames authority as inherently Anglo-American.</p>
                
        <p>Disney’s failure to evolve is starkest in its treatment of hyenas. In the 1994 film, their AAVE-coded speech aligned them with urban stereotypes; the 2025 version avoids this but offers no meaningful alternative, leaving them linguistically neutered. This timidity underscores a broader trend: Disney’s “diverse” remakes often sanitize rather than subvert, prioritizing optics over structural change.</p>  
        <p>The Lion King: Mufasa proves that without intentional linguistic diversity, even visually stunning reboots remain culturally stagnant.</p>
