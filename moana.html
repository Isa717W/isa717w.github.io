        <h1>The Ocean of Accents: Moana’s Balancing Act Between Myth and Realitys</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Disney’s Moana (2016) attempts to celebrate Polynesian culture but stumbles in its linguistic representation. Maui, the demigod voiced by Dwayne Johnson, speaks with a Polynesian-accented English marked by glottal stops (e.g., “Maui” [ˈmɑ.ʔui]) and elongated vowels. These features nod to Indigenous Pacific languages, yet they homogenize diverse Polynesian dialects into a pan-regional “mythic” accent. Meanwhile, the villain Tamatoa’s campy New Zealand English (/ɪ/ → [ə] in “fish” [fəʃ]) ties his flamboyance to queer-coding, reducing LGBTQ+ identity to vocal theatrics.</p>

        <p>Lippi-Green’s critique of Disney’s “foreign accent = exotic” trope looms large here. Maui’s accent, while culturally inspired, lacks specificity—erasing distinctions between Hawaiian, Māori, and Samoan speech patterns. This flattening, as Brous (2021) argues, reduces Polynesia to a monolithic “fantasy” realm, divorced from modern Indigenous realities. Even Moana’s near-GAE, with slight Polynesian inflection, prioritizes Western relatability over authentic representation.</p>
                
        <p>Tamatoa’s accent introduces another layer of stereotyping. His New Zealand English, performed by Jemaine Clement, leans into exaggerated diphthongs and a theatrical delivery that aligns with Western perceptions of queerness as inherently humorous or villainous. The /ɪ/ → [ə] shift (“fish” [fəʃ]) and languid prosody frame him as a decadent, narcissistic figure, perpetuating the trope that non-normative speech signifies moral decay.</p>  
                
        <p>The film’s most glaring omission is its treatment of the Oceanic languages. While Moana incorporates Tokelauan lyrics in “We Know the Way,” the spoken dialogue remains overwhelmingly English-dominant. This erasure of Indigenous languages in favor of accented English reflects what scholar Soares (2017) calls “cultural cherry-picking”—using superficial linguistic elements to signal diversity without engaging deeply with marginalized voices.</p>
                
        <p>Moana’s heartwarming narrative of self-discovery is undermined by its linguistic shortcuts. By blending Polynesian accents into a vague “mythic” past and queering Tamatoa’s villainy through speech, Disney prioritizes marketable exoticism over authenticity. Until the studio commits to nuanced, community-guided representation, even well-intentioned films like Moana will drift in shallow waters.
