        <h1>Día de los Muertos or Día de los Clichés? Coco's Accent Paradox</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Disney's Coco (2017) celebrates Mexican culture but stumbles in its linguistic representation.
            Protagonist Miguel code-switches between General American English (GAE) and Spanish loanwords 
            (“familia” [fɑ'milja]), a bilingual balance meant to bridge cultures. Yet his near-GAE dominance 
            centers whiteness, while Héctor's Mexican-accented English (trilled /r/ in “hermano” ['ɛrmano]) 
            ties his marginalization to his speech. The film's celebration of Día de los Muertos is undermined 
            by erasing Mexico's Indigenous languages, reducing its linguistic diversity to accented English and 
            token Spanish phrases.</p>

        <p> Héctor's accent, performed by Gael García Bernal, humanizes his antihero role but aligns him with 
            stereotypes of the “lovable rogue.” His trilled /r/ and vowel reductions (“forgotten” [fɔr'ɡɔtn̩]) 
            mark him as working-class, perpetuating the trope that accented English signifies lower status. Meanwhile, 
            Ernesto de la Cruz's polished GAE, with only slight Spanish inflection, frames him as a sellout who 
            abandoned his roots for fame. </p>
                
        <p>Coco's linguistic contradictions reflect broader tokenism. While the film incorporates Spanish lyrics and terms, 
            its dialogue remains English-dominant, erasing Nahuatl and other Indigenous languages still spoken in Mexico. 
            Brous (2021) critiques this as “cultural ventriloquism”—using superficial linguistic nods to feign authenticity 
            while centering Anglophone audiences.</p>  
                
        <p>Even the Rivera family's speech patterns reveal hierarchies. Abuelita's stern Spanish-accented English contrasts 
            with Miguel's assimilated GAE, positioning generational conflict as a clash between tradition and modernity. This 
            simplification ignores the complex bilingual realities of Mexican-American families, where code-switching is fluid, 
            not oppositional.</p>
                
        <p>Coco's heartwarming narrative cannot mask its linguistic compromises. By privileging GAE and reducing Mexican identity 
            to accented English, Disney perpetuates the very erasure it claims to combat. True representation requires more than 
            marigold bridges—it demands linguistic justice.</p>
