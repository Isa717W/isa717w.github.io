        <h1>A Recipe for Stereotypes: Ratatouille’s Linguistic Classism</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Pixar’s Ratatouille (2007) serves up a linguistic hierarchy as rigid as its Parisian kitchen’s pecking order. Protagonist Remy, a rat with culinary dreams, speaks General American English (GAE) peppered with French loanwords (“oui” [wi]), framing him as an aspirational hybrid. In contrast, Chef Skinner’s exaggerated French accent—nasal vowels ([ɑ̃]) and /θ/ → [t] substitutions (“thing” [tɪŋ])—mocks Gallic pretentiousness, reducing Frenchness to a laughable caricature.</p>

        <p>The film’s accent coding mirrors colonial attitudes toward French culture. Remy’s GAE, voiced by Patton Oswalt, positions him as a “respectable” outsider assimilating into haute cuisine, while Skinner’s accent (performed by Ian Holm) embodies the elitism Remy must overcome. This dichotomy, as Soares (2017) notes, reinforces the idea that “refined” accents (GAE) are superior to “affected” foreign ones. Even Linguini, the bumbling human protagonist, speaks unmarked GAE, symbolizing everyman mediocrity elevated by Remy’s genius.</p>
                
        <p>Ratatouille’s linguistic classism extends to secondary characters. Ego, the critic, speaks British RP—a dialect associated with sophistication—yet his arc critiques snobbery, creating a contradictory message. Meanwhile, the kitchen staff’s varied European accents (Italian, Spanish) are played for comic relief, framing non-GAE speakers as quirky but incompetent.</p>  
                
        <p>The film’s celebration of culinary artistry is undercut by its reliance on accent stereotypes. By coding Remy’s intelligence through GAE and Skinner’s villainy through a cartoonish French accent, Ratatouille upholds linguistic hierarchies that equate assimilation with success. As Roberts (2022) argues, this “aspirational whiteness” undermines the film’s message about challenging the status quo.</p>
                
        <p>Ratatouille proves that even a film about breaking barriers can simmer in the broth of linguistic prejudice.</p>
