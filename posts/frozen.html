        <h1>Let It Go—Or Not? Frozen's Nordic Villain and the Cold Stereotypes of Accents</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In Frozen (2013), Prince Hans's betrayal is telegraphed not just through his actions but through his Nordic-accented 
            English—a deliberate choice that ties foreignness to villainy. Voiced by Santino Fontana, Hans speaks with retroflex 
            /r/ sounds (e.g., “trust” pronounced with a curled [ʈ]) and fronted /u:/ vowels (“you” becomes [jy:]), markers of a 
            Scandinavian influence. These phonetic features contrast sharply with Elsa's crisp, rhotic General American English 
            (GAE), which aligns her with regal authority and moral clarity.</p>

        <p> Lippi-Green's analysis of Disney's “foreign accent = villain” trope is starkly evident here. While Hans initially 
            appears charming, his accent subtly positions him as an outsider in Arendelle's quasi-Norwegian setting. This irony—using 
            a Nordic accent to code a Scandinavian-coded character as untrustworthy—reveals Disney's preference for GAE as the 
            default “heroic” dialect. Elsa's controlled pitch and lack of regional markers further cement her as a “safe” ruler, 
            despite her magical struggles.</p>
                
        <p>The film's linguistic hierarchy mirrors real-world biases. Nordic accents, though European, are still othered in American 
            media, often relegated to roles emphasizing coldness or aloofness (e.g., Thor's Asgardians). Hans's accent amplifies this, 
            framing him as a calculating interloper rather than a genuine suitor. His vocal traits are weaponized to evoke unease, even 
            before his betrayal is revealed.</p>  
                
        <p>Frozen's duality extends to its protagonists. Anna, though also royal, speaks with a slightly higher pitch and quicker tempo, 
            reflecting her youthful impulsiveness. Yet her GAE lacks the markedness of Hans's accent, ensuring her relatability. Elsa's 
            “Let It Go” anthem, performed in Idina Menzel's Broadway-inflected GAE, underscores her transformation into a self-assured 
            leader—a journey linguistically sanitized of foreign influence.</p>
                
        <p>Critics like Brous (2021) argue that Frozen's progressive themes of sisterhood are undercut by its regressive accent coding. 
            By linking Hans's foreignness to deceit, Disney perpetuates the notion that non-GAE speakers are inherently suspect. This is 
            particularly jarring given the film's Nordic-inspired setting, which could have celebrated Scandinavian linguistic heritage 
            but instead reduces it to a villainous shorthand.</p>
