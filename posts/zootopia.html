        <h1>Prey or Predator? How Zootopia’s Accents Reinforce Real-World Biases</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Zootopia (2016), hailed for its allegory on prejudice, ironically replicates the very biases it critiques through accent coding. Protagonist Judy Hopps’ General American English (GAE)—rhotic /r/, neutral vowels—positions her as an aspirational hero, while antagonist Gideon Gray’s Southern drawl (“right” [raːt]) ties rural foxes to ignorance. The film’s “melting pot” setting masks a rigid linguistic hierarchy where marginalized accents signify moral or intellectual deficiency.</p>

        <p>Valleriani’s (2020) analysis of Zootopia highlights how dubbing practices globalize stereotypes. In the Italian version, Duke Weaselton’s AAVE is replaced with a Neapolitan accent, linking Southern Italian dialects to criminality. Similarly, Mr. Big’s Spanish-influenced English (“’em” for “them”) frames him as a mafia boss, exoticizing foreignness as inherently corrupt. Gazelle’s South American-accented English, with rolled /r/ in “beautiful” ([bea̯ˈt̪iful]), reduces her to a hypersexualized performer, echoing Lippi-Green’s (2012) critique of Latina-coded “spicy” tropes.</p>
                
        <p>Even secondary characters reinforce biases. The polar bear drill instructor’s Southern accent (“dead” [dɛːd]) and Clawhauser’s “gay voice” (high pitch, elongated vowels) reduce regional and LGBTQ+ identities to punchlines. Judy’s parents, despite their rural roots, speak near-GAE—erasing their potential Southern markers to avoid tainting her image. This selective accent use, as Anderson (2019) argues, reveals Disney’s discomfort with non-mainstream speech in heroic roles.</p>  
                
        <p>Zootopia’s attempt to address systemic bias is undermined by its own linguistic shortcuts. By equating accents with archetypes—Southerners as bullies, foreigners as criminals, queerness as comic—the film mirrors real-world discrimination. Until Disney confronts how accent hierarchies perpetuate oppression, even its most “woke” narratives will remain toothless.</p>
