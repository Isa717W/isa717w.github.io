        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>	This blog analyzes how Disney films use accents to portray characters, 
            building on Lippi-Green's (2012) work. For this final project, I investigated whether Disney has evolved its portrayal of linguistic diversity and reduced reliance on 
            harmful stereotypes tied to regional, racial, or class-based accents. Each blog post will focus on a single film, examining how 
            characters' accents align with their roles (protagonist/antagonist), social status, and cultural background. I will identify specific 
            phonological, lexical, and syntactic features of non-mainstream accents (e.g., Southern American English, Chicano English, AAVE) and 
            evaluate whether these choices reinforce or subvert stereotypes. For example, in Zootopia, the Italian dubbed version replaces African 
            American Vernacular English with Neapolitan accents for criminal characters, perpetuating regional prejudice. My analysis will also 
            highlight positive shifts, such as Coco's normalization of Spanish and Chicano English. Click a film above to read! 
        <p> My audience includes educators, parents, Disney enthusiasts, and sociolinguistics students. I aim to raise awareness about how media 
            shapes linguistic perceptions and to encourage critical engagement with Disney's storytelling. The blog website format allows me to 
            present findings accessibly, using clips, phonetic transcriptions, and visual aids to illustrate accent features. I chose this medium 
            to reach a broad audience and foster discussion about representation in children's media.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion & Insights</h2>
        <p>Disney’s accent use remains a double-edged sword. While recent films like Coco and Moana reflect 
            strides toward authentic representation, older tropes persist: villains bear marked accents, women 
            avoid linguistic diversity, and non-European cultures are exoticized. To dismantle stereotypes, 
            Disney must prioritize casting that aligns accents with cultural context rather than moral coding. 
            As Roberts argues, “linguistic diversity should not be sacrificed for palatability” (24). As Brous (41) 
            argues, “having brown advisers doesn’t make it a brown story”—linguistic diversity requires structural 
            change, not tokenism.</p>
